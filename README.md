# Wine Classification using Support Vector Machine with Performance Evaluation Metrics

This project is part of my coursework for the **Advanced Artificial Intelligence Practicum (Machine Learning)** class. It demonstrates the use of the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm to classify wine data, followed by evaluation using several classification metrics.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `svm_wine_classifier_with_metrics.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Training a Support Vector Machine model on the Wine dataset
    
  - Model evaluation using metrics such as:
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Accuracy Score
    - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
    - Classification Report
    - Visualization (if available)

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Wine dataset** from the `sklearn.datasets` module. It contains chemical analysis results of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-svm-classification.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd wine-svm-classification
   ```
   
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook svm_wine_classifier_with_metrics.ipynb
   ```
   
Make sure you have installed all necessary libraries (you can use requirements.txt if available).

## 📌 Learning Objectives
- Implement SVM for multi-class classification
- Understand the behavior of SVM on real-world datasets
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Visualize confusion matrix and classification outcomes
